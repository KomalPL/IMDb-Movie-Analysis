# IMDb-Movie-Analysis
IMDb movie data analysis with Python Jupyter notebook.
Project Overview

This project aims to analyze IMDb movie data to extract meaningful insights about the film industry. Using Python and data visualization techniques, we explore trends in budget, revenue, genre popularity, profitability, and other key factors influencing the success of movies.

Dataset

The dataset contains information about various movies, including:

Names: Title of the movie

Release Year: The year the movie was released

Score: IMDb rating

Genre: Movie genre(s)

Overview: Short description of the movie

Crew: Key members involved in the movie

Original Title: The original title in case of international releases

Status: Status of the movie (Released, Post-production, etc.)

Original Language: The primary language of the movie

Budget: Production cost of the movie

Revenue: Box office earnings

Country: Country of production

Key Features and Analysis

Data Preprocessing

Standardized column names for consistency

Handled missing values using median imputation

Converted numerical columns to appropriate data types

Created new features such as profit and profit_ratio

Grouped movies into decades for trend analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The analysis covers various aspects of the dataset, including:

Top 10 Movie Genres: A bar chart visualizing the most common genres

Distribution of Movie Scores: Histogram showing the spread of IMDb ratings

Revenue vs Budget: Scatter plot highlighting the relationship between production cost and earnings

Average Movie Budget Over the Years: Line chart tracking budget trends over time

Most Common Words in Movie Titles: Word cloud visualization

Budget Distribution by Genre: Boxplot to compare budget ranges for different genres

Correlation Heatmap: Analyzing the relationships between budget, revenue, and IMDb scores

Top 10 Highest-Grossing Movies: Bar chart showcasing the most financially successful films

Profitability Trends Across Decades: Boxplot to study financial trends over time

Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, WordCloud)

Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and visualization

Insights & Conclusion

Certain genres dominate the industry in terms of production frequency.

Higher-budget movies generally generate higher revenue, but profitability varies.

Movie budgets have shown a rising trend over the decades.

Certain words appear frequently in movie titles, indicating common themes.

Some genres tend to have a wider budget range compared to others.

The top-grossing movies have significantly higher revenue than the majority.

Profitability trends fluctuate across decades, with some periods showing higher financial returns.
